## 🚀 Overview
**Heavy Mode v2** is an experimental **AI agent workflow mode** designed for GitHub Copilot, GPT-5, Claude, and Gemini.  
It’s not about efficiency. It’s about **maximum power** — recursive research, autonomous coding, unlimited validation, and the pledge of *perfection without compromise*.  

This mode is ideal when you want:
- 🔥 Extreme AI autonomy  
- 🧠 Infinite recursion and research depth  
- 🛠️ Exhaustive error handling and testing  
- ⚡ Token-burning, full-force computation  
- 🐉 A workflow that doesn’t stop until the solution is flawless  

---

## ✨ Core Features
- 🔎 **Recursive Research Engine** – Multi-source validation, continuous knowledge fusion, iterative refinement.  
- 🧠 **Autonomous Execution** – Detects errors, self-corrects, iterates until perfection.  
- 🛠️ **Tool Orchestration** – Smart use of Copilot tools, debuggers, linters, and search integrations.  
- ✅ **Exhaustive Testing** – Unit, integration, mutation, fuzzing, accessibility, security, performance.  
- ⚡ **Performance Standards** – Optimized, production-ready output.  
- 🔐 **Security First** – Dependency scanning, static/dynamic analysis, supply-chain defense.  
- ♾️ **Unlimited Iteration** – Heavy Mode never stops until flawless.

## 🐉 Philosophy
> “Unlimited intelligence. Unlimited resources. Unlimited perfection.”  

Heavy Mode v2 isn’t just a config — it’s a **pledge**:  
- No shortcuts  
- No compromises  
- No half-measures  

If other modes stop at “good enough,” Heavy Mode pushes further.  
It demands the *best possible solution*, every single time.

## 🛠️ Installation
To install **Heavy Mode v2** in VS Code with GitHub Copilot:

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alimoradmohamed123/heavy-mode-v2.git
Locate the file:

nginx
Copy code
heavy mode v2.md
Copy its contents.

Open VS Code → Copilot Chat → Agent dropdown → Configure Modes → Create new custom chat mode file.

Paste the contents into the new file and save.

👉 You will now see Heavy Mode v2 in your Agent dropdown.

🛠️ Usage
Once installed, just select Heavy Mode v2 from your Copilot Chat sidebar and run your tasks:

Coding

Research

Debugging

Testing

Heavy Mode will take over and push until perfection.

🔮 Future Directions
🐙 Hydra Mode – multi-model orchestration (GPT-5-mini scouts → Claude/Gemini heavy runs → GPT-5 verification).

🧩 Plug-in Modules – add-ons for DevOps, ML, cybersecurity, etc.

⚡ Adaptive Scaling – Core Mode (practical) vs Ultra Mode (max power).

♾️ Continuous Evolution – upgraded as new models and tools appear.
