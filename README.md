## Overview

**Heavy Mode v2** is an experimental AI agent workflow mode designed for **GitHub Copilot, GPT-5, Claude, and Gemini**.
It focuses on **high autonomy, recursive research, and comprehensive validation** to deliver precise and reliable outputs.

This mode is suited for projects that require:

* High AI autonomy and minimal supervision
* Deep iterative research and verification
* Extensive testing and error handling
* Optimized performance and secure execution
* Continuous improvement until the solution meets strict quality standards

---

## Key Features

* **Recursive Research Engine** – Integrates multiple sources and iteratively refines outputs.
* **Autonomous Execution** – Detects errors, self-corrects, and iterates until results are accurate.
* **Tool Orchestration** – Leverages Copilot tools, debuggers, linters, and search integrations effectively.
* **Comprehensive Testing** – Supports unit, integration, mutation, fuzzing, accessibility, security, and performance tests.
* **Security and Compliance** – Includes dependency scanning, static/dynamic analysis, and supply-chain monitoring.
* **Unlimited Iteration** – Continues until solutions meet the highest standards.

## Philosophy

Heavy Mode v2 is designed to deliver **reliable, high-quality outputs without compromise**.
It emphasizes:

* Accuracy and completeness
* Thorough verification
* Practical automation with minimal supervision

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alimoradmohamed123/heavy-mode-v2.git
```

2. Open the file `heavy-mode-v2.md`.
3. In VS Code, go to **Copilot Chat → Agent dropdown → Configure Modes → Create new custom chat mode file**.
4. Paste the contents of `heavy-mode-v2.md` and save.
5. Heavy Mode v2 will now appear in your agent dropdown.

---

## Usage

* Select **Heavy Mode v2** from the Copilot Chat sidebar.
* Use for coding, debugging, research, and testing.
* The agent will iterate autonomously to deliver verified and optimized results.

---

## Future Directions

* **Hydra Mode** – Multi-model orchestration for specialized tasks.
* **Plugin Modules** – Extensions for DevOps, ML, security, and other domains.
* **Adaptive Scaling** – Different modes for practical vs. high-power workflows.
* **Continuous Updates** – Integration with new AI models and tools as they become available.
